## Rules

For the project students work in groups consisting of two to three students. All students must be active during the project. While not all students must participate in all meetings, no student may participate in less than half of the sessions. Have a planning meeting in the beginning to set dates and times for group gatherings. We suggest planning several group meetings per week and with enough time on each gathering to do work. 

During the planning meeting discuss the ambition-level of the group. Read the examination criteria and come up with a plan. 

**All groups are required to have a weekly meeting with the project supervisor.** Time slots will be planned [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qu5aW9imXaxWTpthV_sjVzB7169cBDxHYlATHi5hwbw)

## Requirements

The programming project should contain.
 * IoT device(s)
 * Sensors or other hardware not previously presented in labs
 * Wireless connection
 * Stand-alone (not connected to computer USB)
 
 ## Deliverables

The project should be delived in a GitLab repository. You are to deliver everything needed to complete the project.
 
 * README.md --- Located in the Git root folder. Contains links to all separate project documentation files `/doc`
    -  Must contain the following topics.
      * Project Title
      * Abstract
      * Background and idea
      * Method (links to all project documentation)
      * Results (show pictures)

Project documentation on git in a `/doc` folder. Written in markdown.
  * timelog.md --- A log of group-gatherings, date, record of which students attended, time spent, and a short note on the focus of the gatherings. End the timelog with an total time per student diagram. 
    * Ex. 2020-10-10, Daniel and Morgan, 2 hours, set up breadboard and tested components.
  * requirements.md --- Project requirements (feature-lists, or user-stories (https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) with enough detail so that one can read this and understand what the project is and does.
  * hardware.md --- A description of all hardware components and how to connect them. Take a couple of images.
  * setup.md --- A description of the software components and how to set them up. Dont forget external resources such as Adafruit IO and how to setup and adopt your project to this. 
  * test.md --- A description on how to test the project. Write a short descriptive text on how to run each of the features and
  
Project images on GitLab in a `/img` folder.
Project source on GitLab in a `/src` folder.

## Presentation video

The video should demo your project. Make it fun and interesting.

- The video should be 5-10 min (note, max 10)
- Video on Youtube

 * Excellent --- A Student that participated as much as the average student in the group (when removing students with F)

Deliverables
 * Ok --- Students have everything asked for under deliverables
 * Good --- Students have a clear understandable deliverables with a good structure (headlines, tables etc). Git-history shows progressive work.
 * Excellent --- Everything delivered is polished, time is spent on details. Git shows usage of branches and merges. 
 
Sourcecode

 * Good --- Clear readable sourcecode with methods that follows code standard. Little code duplication. 
 * Excellent --- Good naming of methods. Code divided into classes/methods/libraries and in files. 
 
Project size and complexity
 * Ok --- Students have set a set of requirements and implemented most of those such as in the example project.
 * Good --- Students have deviced their own set of requirements and implemented and tested those.
 * Excellent --- The project does complex things, or contains a lot of requirements or much code. Proejct is well tested. Amaze us!
