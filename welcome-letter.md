## Welcome to Introductory Project, 1DT308

Hello everyone,

Welcome to the course Introductory Projects. My name is Arslan Musaddiq, and I am the course manager for this course. I am based in Kalmar, so you in Växjö probably haven't met me yet. You will also meet another teacher, Lars Karlsson, and TAs during the course.

It will be fun to meet you all, and I look forward to hearing about your upcoming project results. The course has been revised somewhat based on previous years' experiences, and this year, we have chosen to work with Raspberry Pi Pico W. We will start with a Raspberry Pi Pico W (the wireless variant) in the first four labs. After that, if you want to do your own project for a higher grade, you are free to choose any microcontroller.

The course briefly involves carrying out lab sessions with a microcontroller during the first weeks to familiarize you with the hardware and teach the basics. After the first week, for the next four weeks, you will have laboratory sessions where you will connect sensors to the Raspberry Pi Pico W and visualize the sensor data. If you aim for a higher grade, you will build upon the knowledge gained from lectures and lab sessions 0–4 and develop your own project. 

For the higher grade, you will carry out a development project where you will develop an IoT application (both hardware and some form of visualization). The course requires that you take great responsibility for your own studies and prepare yourself now for the fact that you will need to collaborate with your peers. The course is conducted mainly in Kalmar, but lectures will be held online. However, all the lab sessions will take place on-site. Make sure to be on-site for all planned lab sessions - you will need to.

More details about the course will be provided during the course introduction. What you need to do now is join our joint Slack channel #1dt308-introducing-project, where all information will be published _first_ of all. For example, I will publish information about the course introduction there. We will not use Moodle to any great extent, but all information will be available on Gitlab (where the project will also be submitted). Links can be found on Moodle (which is a good starting point).

Once again, welcome to this year's introductory projects course.
